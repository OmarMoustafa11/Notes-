Polymorphism means many forms
when creating a polymorphism class you can have subclasses that only create
overrides for the super class or (parent class).
Casting
in the example on pg216 they use dog
Object o = al.get(index);
Dog d = (Dog) o; casting the object back to a dog that we know is there
d.roam();
if (o instanceof Dog) {
Dog d = (Dog) o; }

     INTERFACE
     Interace class is a 100% abstract class
     what is abstract,
      Abstract is a superclass that cannot be instantiated and is used
     to state or define general characteristics.

      INSTANCE AND LOCAL VARIABLES
      INSTANCE are declared inside a class but not inside a method
      LOCAL declared inside a method, including method parameters

       what are objects and how are they declared in instance variables
       the new keyword is used to create new objects. Declaration − A variable declaration with
       a variable name with an object type. Instantiation − The 'new' keyword is used to create the object.

           A static method is a method that belongs to a class, but it does not belong to an instance of that class and this method can be called without the instance or object of that class.
           Every method in java defaults to a non-static method without static keyword preceding it.
           Non-static methods can access any static method and static variable,
            without creating an instance of the object. Let us clarify the differences Below are the various important differences among these pointers as follows:

        Accessing members and methods
        Calling process
        Binding process
        Overriding process
        Memory allocation
